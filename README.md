Number Guessing Game
Description:
This is a simple interactive game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. The game provides feedback based on the player's guess and allows the game to be reset and played again.

Features:
Random number generation between 1 and 20.
Player enters a guess, and feedback is provided based on the input.
"Too High": If the guess is higher than the generated number.
"Too Low": If the guess is lower than the generated number.
"Correct Number!": If the guess is exactly the generated number.
Player's score decreases with each incorrect guess. When the score reaches 0, the game ends.
The background color changes to green when the correct number is guessed.
The game can be reset to play again by clicking the "Again!" button.
How to Play:
Enter a number between 1 and 20 in the input field.
Click the "Check!" button to see if your guess is correct.
The game will provide feedback whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
You can see your current score, which starts at 20 and decreases with every incorrect guess.
If you want to play again, click the "Again!" button to reset the game.
Example Usage:
Guess the number: Enter your guess in the input field and click "Check!"
Feedback will be shown (e.g., "Too High", "Too Low", or "Correct Number").
The game continues until you guess correctly or run out of points.
After guessing correctly or losing, click "Again!" to reset the game and start over.
